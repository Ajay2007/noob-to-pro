# Noob-To-Pro
This is a 13 week task list to get started with CTFs and we will try to get in to get in to cyber-sec.
Tasks to be Performed are lined up based on number of weeks.
You could find week_no.md files in which the tasks to be done in that week will be present. To make this more interesting and competitive we added some score for each task.

## Important :
* For submissions fork the repo and make a folder by your username and submit by making a PR to main repo. eg  my user name is M1doriya so my submission for week 1 will be in  **submissions / M1doriya / week 1**
* People submitting tasks after the current week will be awarded **half the points**
